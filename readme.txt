Many CSS3 features were used such as:
- text transition (the color of the title slowly changes over 1s when hovered over)
- animation (background changing from black to gray over 4s, transitions between level backgrounds)
- text shadow (title has red shadow)
- opacity
- background image
- font styling
- background size cover (background image stretches over entire canvas)
- dynamic sizing
- color

The open-source and freely usable keymaster.js by Thomas Fuchs was used in order to handle the pressing of multiple buttons at once.
This was the only library used.

Many parts of the program were difficult to implement such as:
- creation and movement of the enemies
- implementation of background image without disrupting rest of canvas
- collision detection
